#if you want to use one method for everthing than look at the third api call in weather controller # data_for_post_code
#IN second apis don't try to use observations directly because it's many to many relations and we have to write  a proper method to access all observations and I think model is a good place , so if you really wanna use one method thing then use my third apis call as a reference, it's actually first + second = third api
